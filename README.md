# Resource Peek

This extension allows you to more easily see the value of your ngx-translate keys - without having to manually search for the key. This is done in two ways:
- Hover over translation keys to see its value of the first translation file.
- Ctrl+click on translation keys to go to value/peek all translation files.

This extension was inspired by similar extensions such as [Angular Follow Selector](https://github.com/SanderLedegen/vscode-angular-follow-selector) and [File Peek](https://github.com/abierbaum/vscode-file-peek).

## Requirements

- Visual Studio Code 1.10+
- An Angular project using [ngx-translate](http://www.ngx-translate.com/)
- Your translation files need to be in assets/i18n
